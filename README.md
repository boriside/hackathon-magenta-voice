## Pre requisite to integrate Magenta Speaker with VR room:

User needs to register himself before using the APP. Its a One time process when user procures a new speaker. Registration is done following three simple steps

1) Login To portal using Google / Facebook account
2) Register the Magenta speaker 
3) A URL will be generated automatically for the VR room. 
User will follow this URL every time when they need to use the virtual-teacher.

## Current Limitaion - Scope for Future work
Portal and user registration feature is not developed as part of the Hackathon. Hence, only one virtual room exists currently and only a single user can use it at a time currently. This limitation will be addressed once user registration functionality is developed.
